# Windows-11-Key-Gen
Generates random strings of characters that follow the requirements of a Windows 11 key.

Automatically copy key to keyboard for automation with a macro(tiny task, macro gamer)

I don't know how long this will take so I recommend using a macro ^^^

You can change the speed of the generated keys on the last line of code: ![image](https://github.com/boi458nose/Windows-11-Key-Gen/assets/116500541/4178333d-950b-47f3-9b0c-62d10a30d16f)

Just change the number to whatever you wish.(using "edit with notepad", notepad++, or anything that can edit text from a file)
